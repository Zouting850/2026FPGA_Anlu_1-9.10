Reference model for the stage 4 transition effects.

Two pieces of RTL are involved and they live in different clock domains, so
this script models both and, more importantly, models the coupling between
them, which is where a mistake would actually hide.

  video_transition.v   video_clk, one decision per frame. Chooses the two
                       buffer selectors, the 4-bit effect code and the fade
                       level. I_mode 0 auto-cycles the ten band effects plus
                       fade, 1..6 and 8..11 force that band effect, 7 forces
                       fade, 12/13/14 are the three non-band effects (instant
                       cut, slow fade, black hold) and 15 is reserved as fade.
                       Only 0..7 are reachable from the DIP switches; the rest
                       come from the serial screen.
  frame_fifo_read.v    ext_mem_clk, one burst at a time. Turns the two
                       selectors plus the effect code into read base addresses.
                       During a band effect it consults
                       select_top(group, progress, effect) at every two-line
                       group boundary and redirects the address by +/- the
                       buffer delta whenever the selection flips, so a whole
                       family of vertical sweeps (wipe down/up, blinds, split,
                       random bars, comb, pincer, interlace, coarse blocks,
                       quad interleave) shares the one proven redirect
                       mechanism. effect=1 reproduces the original single
                       crossing wipe bit for bit.

Passes
  A  controller sequencing, frame granularity.
  B  frame_fifo_read regression. The stage 4 module and the pre-stage-4 module
     are run side by side on identical pseudo random stimulus and every
     observable register is compared every cycle. This is the guard on the one
     change that touches a module already verified on hardware.
  C  frame_fifo_read at the real geometry, one frame per selected boundary
     position, checking the buffer attribution of every single word (effect=1,
     the legacy single crossing wipe).
  D  coupled run: the controller drives the selectors that the read model
     consumes, at a scaled down geometry so that hundreds of frames are cheap,
     verifying what the panel would actually show. Forced to wipe-down so it
     stays the hardware-verified single-boundary regression.
  E  parameter consistency, read back out of the RTL sources so the check
     cannot drift away from what is actually instantiated, including the fade
     budgets of all three fade-shaped effects.
  F  I_mode (4 bit) selects which effect the controller commits to: the
     auto-cycle rotation over all sixteen codes, each forced band effect, each
     forced non-band effect, and the reserved code falling through to fade.
     Asserts the rotation never surfaces 12/13/14.
  G  band effect geometry: all ten band effects across the whole ramp, checking
     the select_top pattern, full coverage at saturation, word-by-word buffer
     attribution through the FSM, and that redirects only ever fire on a group
     boundary. Carries a negative control on the saturation guard that effects
     3/4/5 need, and a separate one proving effects 8..11 do NOT need it.
  H  the three non-band effects traced frame by frame: how many frames each
     takes, on which frame the picture index changes, what the brightness does
     in between, how long ST_BLACK dwells, and that the band engine stays
     inert throughout. Negative controls on the flag-written-but-never-read
     bug class.

Exit code is 0 only if every gated check passed.

    wipe=False reproduces the module exactly as it was before stage 4.
    wipe=True adds read_addr_index_top plus the group aligned redirect, now
    generalized from ONE crossing to a programmable per group buffer selection
    driven by `effect`. select_top(g, progress, effect) decides, for each two
    line group g, whether that group reads from the top buffer (1) or the bottom
    buffer (0); the address is redirected by +/- wipe_delta at every group
    boundary where the selection flips, which preserves the intra frame word
    offset exactly as the single crossing did. effect=1 (wipe down) reproduces
    the original single crossing wipe bit for bit, which is what Pass C and
    Pass D still rely on. When the two selectors are driven equal the band
    engine is inert (progress=g=cur_sel=next_sel_r=deltas all stay zero) and the
