// select_top: the band geometry. For a two line group g, at the frozen ramp
// position prog, under effect code eff, return 1 if that group reads from the
// top buffer (read_addr_index_top) and 0 if it reads from the bottom one
// (read_addr_index). This one function is the generalization that turns the old
// single crossing wipe into a family of vertical sweeps; effect 1 IS that old
// wipe, bit for bit.
//
// Every branch is compares, add/sub, constant shifts, a bit mask and a bit
// reverse, so there is no divider and no DSP. The prog >= WIPE_GRP_MAX guard on
// blinds/split/random is what reveals the last slat / outermost group / last bar
// at the saturated end of the ramp; without it those three effects leave holes in
// the panel, which is exactly what the negative control in Pass G of
// tools/sim_transition.py checks for. WIPE_GRP_MAX is 240 here, so the blinds
// slat is 16 groups (15 slats), the split centre is 120, and bitrev8 spreads the
// 240 group indices over 0..255.
//
// Codes 8..B are the four effects added for the serial screen. They need NO
// saturation guard, because each one compares a pure bit permutation of gi (a
// bit reverse or a rotate -- free wiring, no logic and, critically, no
// subtractor in series with gi) against a threshold the ramp provably outruns:
//
//   8 pincer     gi < (prog>>1) || gi >= 240-(prog>>1); at prog=240 that is
//                gi<120 || gi>=120, true for every gi, and at prog=0 false for
//                every gi.
//   9 interlace  key {gi[0],gi[7:1]} <= 128+119 = 247 < prog+(prog>>3) at 240,
//                which is 270.
//   A coarse     key bitrev4(gi[7:4]) <= 14 (gi <= 239 so gi[7:4] <= 14, and
//                bitrev4 is a bijection) < prog>>4 at 240, which is 15.
//   B quad       key {gi[1:0],gi[7:2]} <= 3*64+59 = 251 < 270.
//
// The existing six case items still say 3'd. That is deliberate: Verilog
// zero-extends case items to the width of the case expression, so their geometry
// is bit-for-bit what it was when eff was 3 bits, and leaving the text alone
// makes that claim checkable by inspection rather than by re-derivation.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Stage 5 band effect bookkeeping.
//
// This generalizes the old single crossing wipe. Where the wipe crossed the
// buffer boundary exactly once per frame, a band effect can flip the selection at
// any number of group boundaries, and select_top decides which side each group
// comes from. Six registers, all held stable across a frame read:
//
//   progress        the ramp position in two line groups. Loaded once per frame
//                   read at s_ack_first, frozen for the whole frame so every
//                   group evaluates select_top against the same value, and it
//                   accumulates across frames so the sweep walks down the panel.
//   g               the group index within the frame, 0..239. Advances at every
//                   group aligned burst boundary while the selectors disagree.
//   cur_sel         the buffer the CURRENT group reads from; always equals
//                   select_top(g, progress, effect). Latched from first_sel at
//                   s_ack_first and from next_sel_r at each flip.
//   next_sel_r      select_top(g+1, progress, effect), registered EVERY cycle so
//                   the address mux and the redirect test only ever see a flop
//                   output. This is what keeps select_top's combinational depth
//                   off the ext_mem_clk address register D path.
//   burst_in_grp    0..4; five 256 word bursts make one 1280 word = two line
//                   group. Free runs on every burst boundary, harmless when no
//                   band is running because do_redirect is gated by the
//                   selectors disagreeing.
//   wipe_delta      base_bottom - base_top, added when a flip steps down into the
//   neg_wipe_delta  base_top - base_bottom, added when a flip steps up. Both are
//                   precomputed at s_ack_first so the redirect is a 2:1 mux, not
//                   a subtractor, on the timing critical address path.
//
// next_sel_r is registered unconditionally; progress, g and cur_sel update only
// on the single cycle events s_ack_first and a group aligned rd_burst_finish.
// S_ACK itself lasts as long as read_req is held, several mem_clk cycles, so the
// non idempotent loads are gated by s_ack_first. When the two selectors are equal
// (fade or idle) progress and cur_sel are held at zero, g never advances, and
// next_sel_r stays select_top(1, 0, effect) = 0, so the whole engine is inert and
// the module reads exactly as it did before any wipe existed.
//
// Nothing else about the frame read is touched: same burst count, same burst
// length, same read_cnt, same FIFO control, same rd_delay, same App_rd_en
// pattern. Only the value loaded into the address register differs, and only
// at a word offset that is an exact multiple of two lines, so no burst ever
// straddles two buffers and the read FIFO sees an identical stream shape.
