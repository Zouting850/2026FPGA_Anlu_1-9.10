// SD sector-read port arbiter.
//
// A grant lasts exactly one sector. sd_card_sec_read_write latches the address
// in S_WAIT_READ_WRITE on any cycle sd_sec_read is high and returns to that
// state only via the single-cycle S_READ_END, so releasing on sd_sec_read_end
// hands the port over at the only point where changing hands is safe.
//
// Two properties here are load-bearing, not stylistic:
//
// 1. sd_sec_read is driven by the owner flags alone, never by the consumer's
//    request. Both consumers drop their request for exactly one cycle at each
//    sector boundary and re-assert it with addr+1 (bmp_read ST_LOAD_DATA,
//    sd_audio_stream S_READ), and the arbiter is idle on that very cycle.
//    Passing the request through would let the reader latch a sector the
//    arbiter had not granted while the grant went to the other consumer, so the
//    grantee would ingest 512 bytes belonging to someone else.
//
// 2. Because sd_sec_read does not depend on the request, a granted sector
//    always runs to its end pulse whatever the consumer does next. load_abort
//    puts bmp_read back in ST_IDLE and a failed RIFF/WAVE check puts the
//    streamer in S_FAULT, both with their request low; the arbiter still gets
//    its release, so "hand over on sd_sec_read_end" is total rather than
//    conditional on the consumer cooperating. The cost is one wasted sector,
//    whose bytes the withdrawn owner ignores: bmp_read sits in ST_IDLE where
//    reading_sector is false, so rd_cnt stays 0, and bmp_len_cnt only counts
//    in ST_LOAD_DATA.
//
// Audio wins ties. Its 512-frame FIFO is a hard ~10.7 ms deadline -- an underrun
// is audible silence -- while a picture loses nothing by waiting one sector for
// its next load slot. At 48 kHz stereo 16-bit it asks for one sector per 2.67 ms
// against a port that delivers one in roughly 184 us, so it takes about 7% of
// the bandwidth and the picture loads barely notice.
